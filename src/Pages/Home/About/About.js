        Hello, i'm Fahad AL Fahim.From Bogura, Bangladesh. My goal is to be a
        web developer. This January I started to reach my goal with
        programming-hero. I have learned Html, CSS, javascript basic, and some
        advanced topic. Now I'm learning to react js and make this website with
        react. I have a dream to work in a big company with senior developers
        and create so many awesome websites. In this learning period, I'm so
        happy with Jhankar Mahbub sir's teaching style, his fun with coding, and
        his inspiration.
        <small> Thanks for visit my website</small>{" "}
